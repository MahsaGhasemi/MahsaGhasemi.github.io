I will be joining the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University as an Assistant Professor in August 2021. If you are a student interested in working with me, feel free to reach out.\nMy research focuses on developing theory and algorithms that enable autonomous agents to co-exist with humans in our complex world. The algorithms I develop address the following fundamental challenges:\n Active identification and gathering of actionable information from large-scale, multi-modal, and noisy data. Planning and learning based on partial and evolving knowledge, in real time and with theoretical performance guarantees. Interacting and collaborating with humans in a trustworthy manner.  I tackle these challenges by drawing innovative connections between the fields of control, learning, formal methods, and information theory. My contributions enable efficient and reliable integration of autonomy in various applications such as robotics, shared autonomy, and networked systems. Prior to Ph.D., I received my B.Sc. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2014, and my M.S.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, USA, in 2017.\nResearch Interests  Artificial Intelligence Control Systems Formal Methods Robotics  ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://MahsaGhasemi.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at The University of Texas at Austin, supervised by Prof. Ufuk Topcu.
